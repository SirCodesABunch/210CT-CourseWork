// Put everything in word DOC
// Write aboue week 1's tasks!

For both previous tasks, provide a basic answer (no fancy solution or mathematical proof required) to
the following questions:
a. Does your algorithm have defined inputs and outputs?
b. Can you guarantee that it terminates?
c. Is it specified in a clear and concise manner?
d. Does your algorithm produce the correct result for all instances?
